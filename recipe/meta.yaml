  summary: faster and more efficient pyscal distribution

  description: |
    pyscal is a python module for the calculation of local 
    atomic structural environments including Steinhardt's bond 
    orientational order parameters [1] during post-processing 
    of atomistic simulation data. The core functionality of 
    pyscal is written in C++ with python wrappers using 
    pybind11 which allows for fast calculations with possibilities 
    for easy expansion in python.
